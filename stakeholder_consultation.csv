This creates a European computing fabric , including connection to the new AI factories. Moreover, Blue-Cloud can be incubator of new algorithms which then can be made availalble to EDITO users via smart federation and porting. Blue-Cloud can promote the EDITO data lake, including its underlying EMODnet and Copernicus Marine data products offer to Blue-Cloud and wider EOSC community.
