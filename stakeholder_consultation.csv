Joint Development of Services: Blue-Cloud and EDITO could collaborate to develop new services that address specific user needs. For example, they could jointly develop a service for assessing the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems.

Joint Training and Outreach: Blue-Cloud and EDITO could collaborate on training programs and outreach activities to educate users about the capabilities of both platforms and promote their use.";"Enhance Data FAIRness and Accessibility: The Consortium should continue its work on making marine data FAIR. This aligns directly with the Decade's emphasis on ensuring that ocean data is openly available and usable by a wide range of stakeholders.   

Develop Solutions for Sustainable Development: Blue-Cloud should prioritize the development of Virtual Labs (VLabs) and analytical workflows that address key challenges related to sustainable ocean development. This includes addressing issues like climate change impacts, pollution, biodiversity loss, and sustainable fisheries.   

Promote International Collaboration: The Consortium should actively seek collaborations with international partners and initiatives within the framework of the UN Decade. This will help to scale up the impact of Blue-Cloud's activities and ensure that its resources are available to a global community of users.   

Support Capacity Building and Training: Blue-Cloud should expand its training programs to build capacity in ocean science, data management, and the use of its platforms. This will empower researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to effectively use ocean data to support sustainable development.   

Facilitate Digital Twin Ocean Development: The Consortium should continue to align its activities with the development of Digital Twin Ocean (DTO) initiatives, such as EDITO. By providing data, tools, and services to DTO platforms, Blue-Cloud can contribute to the creation of virtual representations of the ocean that can be used to support sustainable management and policy-making.";;Yes
Miguel Charcos Llorens;SOCIB;mcharcos@socib.es;Marine (data) scientist and/or researcher (either from the public and/or private sector);Research and/or data infrastructure (data and service providers);Good;No;;;;;;;;;;Yes;"My motivation for using the Blue-Cloud Virtual Research Environment (VRE) stems from its potential to act as a flexible, collaborative space for exploring, integrating, and analyzing marine and coastal data. I am particularly interested in the Virtual Labs (VLabs) as tools that enable not only co-creation of workflows but also experimentation with diverse datasets in the context of Research Infrastructures and emerging frameworks such as Digital Twins of the Ocean.

The features I find most compelling include:
(1) The ability to customize and chain analytical tools in workflows;
(2) Access to distributed data sources through a single interoperable environment;
(3) The possibility to share and reproduce results easily within the research community.

Regarding data sources, I am especially interested in:
(1) Copernicus Marine Service (CMEMS) products,
(2) SeaDataNet,
(3) EMODnet datasets,
(4) and other federated sources relevant for coastal observatories, such as SOCIB or even in the context of CoastPredict.

Suggestions for improvement:
(1) Strengthen integration with FAIR-enabling services (e.g., maDMPs, persistent identifiers, provenance tracking);
(2) Expand support for Science Knowledge Graphs to enhance data discoverability and semantic linking;
(3) Facilitate the deployment of docker services and allow more control over these services.
(4) Provide better support for co-design between scientific users and data providers, possibly through interactive tutorials or “sandbox” templates for Digital Twin pilots.";Yes;"My motivation for using the Blue-Cloud Data Discovery & Access Service (DD&AS) lies in its ability to provide unified, FAIR-aligned access to marine data across multiple Blue Data Infrastructures (BDIs). It is a crucial enabler for building integrated workflows in research environments and emerging digital ecosystems, such as Digital Twins of the Ocean and cross-disciplinary Research Infrastructures.

DDAS is a clear move toward improving metadata quality and semantic interoperability, which is critical for data reuse and discovery. An improvement could be toward the integration with maDMPs to support automated data planning and traceability.";Yes;"My motivation for using the Blue-Cloud Data Lakes, and particularly the Beacon technology, is rooted in the need for efficient, targeted access to large and complex marine datasets, which is a cornerstone for building effective workflows in Digital Twins and other modelling and data integration environments. The ability to subset and slice data directly at the source is a powerful enabler for advanced analytics, reproducibility, and reduced computational overhead.

The features I find most useful are:
(1) Granular sub-setting capabilities, such as extracting data by variable, threshold, depth range, and time window;
(2) The move toward merged Beacon instances, offering harmonised access across multiple data collections (e.g., for EOVs like Temperature, Salinity, or Eutrophication).

I'm not fully familiar now with them yet, but the difference between a ""software"" (I don't know the correct name, but with a url like {software name}-bluecloud.d4science.org) and a CCP Method is pretty confusing. When do we should use one or another ? (When there's a UI -> Software, else CCP ?). Is the CCP & ""Software"" using the same infrastructure with the same scalability ?

I assume that CCP is more optimized than Galaxy (mainly on the scalability), but is it really useful ? Galaxy is open-source with a huge community engagement.

It provides a powerful platform where I can combine oceanographic, environmental, and biological datasets—such as those related to seaweed cultivation, water quality, and marine ecosystems—to support my research and innovation activities more efficiently.

Through Blue-Cloud's virtual research environments, data discovery services, and computational tools, I can run analyses, share results, and collaborate with others across disciplines without needing to manage complex data infrastructures myself. This saves time, enhances data reliability, and fosters interdisciplinary collaboration—especially important for tackling complex issues like sustainable aquaculture, nutrient cycling, and the blue economy.";"Considering the full range of services offered by Blue-Cloud, the services that provide the greatest added value to me are:

Virtual Research Environment (VRE):
This is especially valuable for conducting integrated, large-scale analyses without needing to set up local infrastructure. As a researcher working on seaweed-based composting, phosphorus cycling, and blue economy applications, the ability to process marine datasets and models collaboratively within the VRE greatly enhances the efficiency and reproducibility of my work.

Data Discovery and Access Service (DD&AS):
I appreciate how this service simplifies the process of finding and accessing harmonized marine data from trusted sources like EMODnet, Copernicus Marine, and others. For example, getting access to ocean parameters, coastal conditions, or seaweed biomass data becomes seamless—helping me ground my studies in real environmental contexts.

Notebook Service and Workflow Automation:
The ability to create, customize, and reuse data processing workflows and interactive Jupyter notebooks makes it easier to test hypotheses, perform simulations, and share findings. This transparency and automation are key for interdisciplinary and policy-relevant research.

Most appreciated features:

The interoperability between datasets from different sources.

The collaborative tools that facilitate teamwork across institutions and disciplines.

The reproducibility and traceability of analyses through versioning and shared workflows.";"I would like Blue-Cloud to improve its service offering in the following ways:

More Thematic Datasets and Regional Coverage:
Expanding the availability of localized or region-specific data, especially for underrepresented coastal areas like South Asia (e.g., Bay of Bengal, Cox’s Bazar, and Saint Martin’s Island) would significantly enhance its value for researchers like me. This includes high-resolution data on coastal ecosystems, biodiversity, seaweed distribution, and nutrient dynamics.

Better Integration with Socioeconomic and Policy Data:
Since sustainable ocean research increasingly links environmental science with socioeconomic impacts, integrating marine-related policy, fisheries economics, and livelihood data into the platform would support broader blue economy assessments.

Enhanced User Support and Training Tools:
More interactive tutorials, use-case examples, and community-driven resources (especially for early-career researchers or users with less programming experience) would make the platform more accessible and inclusive. Live support or user forums for troubleshooting workflows would also be helpful.

Mobile-Friendly and Offline Features:
While Blue-Cloud is already a robust web-based system, offering lightweight mobile access or downloadable tools for offline use could increase usability in field conditions or regions with limited internet access.

These improvements would make Blue-Cloud even more effective as a global tool for ocean sustainability, particularly for applied research and innovation in regions currently underserved by digital marine infrastructure.";No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;No;;Yes;"Title: Exploring the Potential and Impact of the “Global Fisheries Atlas” VLab in Blue-Cloud

To us, it is most important that there is as much *high-quality* data as possible available within the DD&AS before developing other services on top of it. If the data in available through the DD&AS isn't standardized according to the same standards, it won't be possible to perform data transformations on-the-fly, which is the power of such data catalogues.

As for the variables to focus on: first focus on the essential physical environmental variables such as air temperature at 2m, wind speed, sea surface temperature, radiation, etc. Those environmental are easiest to create longer timeseries of, as they can be remotely and consistently be measured and retrieved. Also, these physical parameters are essential for most disciplines, as they give say something about the context in which the data has been collected.

At SIOS we pre-dominantly focus on upkeeping a high-quality set of 'SIOS Core Data', for such essential physical environmental variables (52 in total as of now). For those variables we can pose data providers a stricter set of requirements, so that these variables can be more standardized. For that reason it's easier to build services on top of these data, and hence these data can serve as a proof-of-concept to showcase the power and possibilities of standardized data.";Yes;I have not used this service, but it looks very promising from previous presentations I have attended.

It is vital for such a platform to also include data from other disciplines. Earth System Science challenges are not solved in on single discipline alone.

If not, the Earth System Science community will be far less obliged to use and help build the platform.;I slightly disagree;I fully disagree;I fully disagree;"I disagree with '... following EMODnet standards ...', because EMODnet standards do not allow for multi-disciplinarity. It is very heavily marine-focused, and there is no place to put metadata that are vital to other disciplines in this metadata standard. Therefore we should create a more hollistic metadata standard, that has room for a much wider range of metadata. This is also vital for working multidisciplinary in a service like the EOSC. Amongst others, we are working on creating such a metadata standard in POLARIN, as the project is multidisciplinary and the data services should accomodate for multiple disciplines as well.

Open Science is important also here: upon integration of more data, the additional data should also be openly accessible!";"Integration more *high-quality* data, by getting more data centers on board with the standards that are being pushed by Blue-Cloud and other similar HORIZON-EU projects. 

Preferably, all HORIZON-EU projects would have one hollistic metadata standard that encompasses all the scientific disciplines, which is hopefully something the research community will converge to in upcoming years / decades.";Thanks for this project synthesization effort, I think it is very wortwhile to have this round of feedback in many similar (HORIZON-)EU projects too!;Yes
